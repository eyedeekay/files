<h3>2014-07-26: <b>0.9.14 <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/blog/post/2014/07/26/0.9.14-Release">Released</a></b></h3>
<p>
0.9.14 includes critical fixes for XSS and remote execution vulnerabilities reported by Exodus Intel.
As an added precaution, we have disabled several advanced configuration features in the router console, including installation of new plugins.
We plan to re-enable these in a future release after additional review.
</p><p>
Due to I2P library changes, I2P-Bote users must upgrade their plugin to version 0.2.10 to work with I2P 0.9.14.
Your router should update the plugin automatically after the router restarts.
</p><p>
The release also contains several bug fixes in i2ptunnel, i2psnark, and other areas,
and updates to the latest Jetty, Tomcat, and Wrapper.
We've also implemented a faster and more secure method for reseeding.
Of course, there's also the usual collection of minor bug fixes and translation updates.
</p><p>
All users should update immediately.
