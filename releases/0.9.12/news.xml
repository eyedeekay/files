<h3>2014-03-31: <b>0.9.12 <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/blog/post/2014/03/31/0.9.12-Release">Released</a></b></h3>
<p>
I2P now requires Java 6 or higher.
We strongly recommend that you upgrade to Java 7.
If you are still using Java 5, you must upgrade your Java before installing I2P 0.9.12.
</p><p>
0.9.12 adds preliminary support for ECDSA-signed Destinations.
It contains several fixes for the handling of Delivery Status Messages (acknowledgements)
and those messages are now end-to-end encrypted for increased security.
</p><p>
We have upgraded to Jetty 8.
Jetty 8 is almost identical to Jetty 7, so there are no complex configuration file conversions as there have been in past Jetty upgrades.
No manual changes should be necessary.
</p><p>
Of course, there's also the usual collection of bug fixes.
All users should update.

Search engine <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> recently
<a href="https://duck.co/blog/foss2014">donated</a> $5000 to I2P in their annual open-source
donation program. The award was granted on the basis of
<a href="https://duck.co/forum/thread/5174/foss-donation-nomations-2014-edition">nominations</a>
on the DuckDuckGo community portal.
</p><p>
This marks the single largest donation ever received by I2P and reflects a growing interest in
privacy and security by the Internet community. The funding will help I2P to reach more users, expand
development, audit the code, and attend conferences.
I2P thanks Gabriel Weinberg and DuckDuckGo for the generous donation,
and the I2P community for its support in the nominations.
