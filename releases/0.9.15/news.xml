<h3>2014-09-20: <b>0.9.15 <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/blog/post/2014/09/20/0.9.15-Release">Released</a></b></h3>
<p>
0.9.15 adds preliminary support for Ed25519 EdDSA signatures.
It includes a new persistent configuration backend for i2psnark and fixes several issues with i2psnark's handling of file names.
There are several improvements for SAM performance.
Plugins now support stronger signatures in the su3 file format.
<a href="/configclients#plugin">Plugin installation</a>, which was disabled in 0.9.14, is re-enabled.
</p><p>
We have supported ECDSA signatures since 0.9.12, and we would like to start using ECDSA by default.
Unfortunately, some of you are still running older I2P versions, and for others,
their distribution or Java runtime does not support ECDSA. Red Hat
(RHEL, Fedora) distributions are reported to be missing ECDSA.
Some have fixed the Java issues by upgrading from Java 6 to Java 7;
others have had success installing the "unlimited strength policy files".
We've added information about missing crypto to the <a href="/logs">logs page</a>.
After you update, please check if you are missing ECDSA support, and attempt to fix it if necessary.
This is particularly important for those that run popular eepsites and services.
</p><p>
As usual, we recommend that you update to this release. The best way to
maintain security and help the network is to run the latest release.
